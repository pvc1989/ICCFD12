\section{Introduction}
To construct high-order schemes on unstructured meshes, the discontinuous Gakerlin (DG) method and the flux reconstruction (FR) method are two of the most popular choices in the community of computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
%
Besides the inherent compactness, these schemes are much easier to implement $p$-refinement than their finite difference and finite volume counterparts.
%
However, like other high-order schemes, numerical oscillations would appear near discontinuities or large gradients in the solution given by a DG or FR scheme, if no shock capturing mechanism were incorporated into it.

In this paper, a novel artificial viscosity based on an energy measure of oscillation and its damping rate on a DG or FR element is developed.
%
The oscillation energy, which measures the amplitude of numerical oscillations on a given element, is obtained by evaluating the $L_2$-norm of the difference between the numerical solutions on the element and its neighbors.
%
The damping rate of this energy on an element can be derived under the assumptions of linear flux--gradient relation and constant viscosity distribution.
%
The value of viscosity for suppressing numerical oscillations is obtained by taking the ratio of the oscillation energy with respect to the product of its damping rate and prescribed time step.
%
Such element-wise constant viscosity distribution is reconstructed to be $C_0$ constinuous on element interfaces.

Standard cases for testing shock capturing schemes show that the proposed mechanism is sufficiently large for suppressing numerical oscillations near physical discontinuities, such as shocks and contacts, while keeps negligible in other regions for maintaing the high-orderness of the DG or FR solution.

\section{Problem Statement}
This document allows you to easily include references \cite{book,journalpaper}, equations, figures or anything else you
desire into a clean and compact environment of \LaTeX.  For example if you'd like to impress a date you can write
the unsteady heat equation as

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{V}}{\partial t} - \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{V}}{\partial x^2} +
       \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{V}}{\partial y^2} +
       \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{V}}{\partial z^2} \right)
= 0
\laeq{heat}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x, y, z$ are the space dimensions and $\alpha$ is a parameter.  If you felt inclined you could define $\mathbf{V}$ as
%
$$\mathbf{V} = y^2 z - \text{cos}(0.1 x)$$
%
for a non-exact solution.  Computational fluid dynamics~\cite{paper} can be used to discretize the equations, apply boundary conditions and 
simulation the unsteady nature of the flow.  An innovative method to simulate the heat equation could even be submitted to ICCFD10.

\section{Results}
In this section, the effectiveness of the artificial viscosity proposed in the previous section is demonstrated by some standard test cases.
The computational domain is divide into $100$ elements uniformly.
A fifth-order ($p=4$) FR scheme using the $g_2$ correction function, which is equivalent to a DGSEM scheme of the same order of accuracy, is used for spatial discretization.
The resulting ODE system is solved by an explicit three-stage third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta method.

\subsection{Shock Tube Problems}
Riemann problems, as well as their exact and approximate solvers, play a pivot role in the development of CFD schemes.
Among the infinite number of Riemann problems of the 1D Euler system, the Sod problem with the initial condition
\begin{equation}
\mqty[\rho & u & p]_{t=0}
=
\begin{cases}
\mqty[1 & 0 & 1], &x<0,\\
\mqty[0.125 & 0 & 0.1], &x>0,\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and the Lax problem in with the initial condition
\begin{equation}
\mqty[\rho & u & p]_{t=0}
=
\begin{cases}
\mqty[0.445 & 0.698 & 3.528], &x<0,\\
\mqty[0.5 & 0 & 0.571], &x>0,\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
are two of the most famous ones that are frequently used for testing shock capturing mechanisms.

Figure \ref{fig:sod} and \ref{fig:lax} gives the solution (the "Actual" curves) of these two problems at the moment ($t=0.5$ for Sod, $t=0.3$ for Lax) and the viscosity distributions for each characteristic variables at all time steps.
The "Expect" curves in these figures are the exact solutions obtained from analytical procedures.

\subsection{The Shu--Osher Problem}\label{sec:shu_osher}
This problem is designed to mimic the interaction of a running shock with a standing isentropic wave.
The computational domain is $x\in[0, 10]$ with two no-reflection conditions applied at the left and right boundaries.
The time range of interest is $t\in[0, 1.8]$ with the initial condition set to be
\begin{equation}
\mqty[\rho & u & p]_{t=0}
=
\begin{cases}
\mqty[3.857143 & 2.629369 & 10.33333], &x\in[0,1);\\
\mqty[1+0.2\sin(5x) & 0 & 1], &x\in(1,10].
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:shu_osher} gives the solution (the "Actual" curve) of this problem at the final ($t=1.8$) moment and the viscosity distribution for each characteristic variables at all time steps.
The "Expect" curve in this figure is the approximate solution given by the same FR scheme with a $p$-weighted limiter on a finer mesh (200 elements).
